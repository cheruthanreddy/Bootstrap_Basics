I have worked on **Bootstrap fundamentals**, exploring various components and styling techniques. My expertise includes:  

- **Alerts** – Success, Danger, Warning, Info  

- **Buttons** – Success, Danger, Primary, Info, Basic, Default, Link, Warning  

- **Tables** – Striped, Hover, Bordered, Condensed  

- **Images** – Rounded Corners, Thumbnail, Circle, Responsive  

Through these implementations, I have gained hands-on experience in Bootstrap, enhancing the responsiveness and aesthetics of web applications.
